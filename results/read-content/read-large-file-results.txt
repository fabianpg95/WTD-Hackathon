"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes. I don't know."

"Where did he live, then?"

"He slept on the premises."

"And you don't know his address?"

"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."

"Where did you address your letters, then?"

"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I promised to always letter my letters like that."

"You think he was quite in earnest?"

"Yes, Mr. Holmes. He was too good and kind to be anything else."

"Then we met him together there, and of course mother saw as well as I did that he was a likely man. He had a weak voice, never thought much of his looks, but he was an excellent guy."

"Have you ever seen him wearing spectacles?"

"Yes, Mr. Holmes. He said they were to help his weak eyesight, but he actually read quite well without them."

"You really are an honest and investigating witness, Miss Sutherland," said Holmes. "I see no signs of trickery about your testimony. Your account of these events is quite clear. Now can you remember any peculiar or unusual mannerism of Hosmer Angel? Anything by which you could recognize him again?"

A quick look of surprise passed over her worn face. "Oh, Mr. Holmes!" she exclaimed in a tone of reproof, "do you think I would forget him? That's enough for me!"

"As I have repeated your words precisely, you can comprehend how they might appear a trifle disjointed," said he. "I asked about any peculiarities of his."

"Well, I don't know!" she said. "I was fully stuck on him, I've said that multiple times. But I don't think he was given to any singularities in his behavior. Maybe I haven't paid much attention to that."

"So, Mr. Hosmer Angel disappeared relatively abruptly after your stepfather's return from France?"

"Yes, sir."

"And now, having heard about the mask behind the glasses and all these other vague detours, you have logically come to the conclusion that there is much more to this scenario than meets the untrained eye?"

"I believe so, Mr. Holmes."

Holmes paused, seemingly deep in thought. "Dear Miss Sutherland," he said at last, "if you would convey any documents – letters, for instance – pertaining to Mr. Hosmer Angel to us here at once, it would aid our investigation substantially. Also, a detailed description of his appearance, any peculiar traits, and the exact timeline of your encounters."

"I surely can, if it will help."

"It will help immensely," returned Holmes. "Now, please, tell your prior narrative concisely for clarity."

Miss Sutherland shuffled through her handbag and handed over a sheaf of papers. Holmes scrutinized each sheet before laying them all onto his desk.

"Will you see it through?" asked Miss Sutherland suddenly, as if an arduous query lingered unaddressed.

"Indeed, I will," said Holmes with an assuring nod. "One more thing – your conjecture reveals a sophisticated paradox, which, as hyperbolic as it may seem—promises an intriguing anomaly. Fear not, we shall leave no stone unturned."

Miss Sutherland sighed with apparent relief and left Holmes and Watson deep in consultation over her documents.

"Watson, the game is afoot!" said Holmes after a brief survey. "To the post office first—then it's a decisive ruse."

Holmes’s deduction was swift and uncanny. He unraveled Angel’s disguise faster than any stranger’s—revealing that it was none other than Windibank masquerading as Angel in an effort to secure his wife's family fortune.

The reasons were clear. Holmes had resolved the intricate riddle, bringing light where shadows loomed. For Mary Sutherland, it was a bittersweet epiphany, a necessary truth.

The cases Holmes encountered were not mere coincidences of reality but delicate tapestries concealing the strands of human folly, intrigue, and sometimes, heart—deftly uncovered by his exceptional acumen.

Only one thing is evident: In the realm engulfing Sherlock Holmes's investigative endeavors, even the simplest seeming anecdotes conceal bastions of untold complexity and wonder.
