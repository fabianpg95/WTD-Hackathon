      - College bus routes: **Graph**

2. **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.
    - Designing & Analyzing:
        1. Understand the problem.
        2. Plan the solution.
        3. Write the algorithm.
        4. Analyze time and space complexity.

        - **Omega (Ω(n))**: Lower bound.
        - **Theta (θ(n))**: Exact bound.

### UNIT-II
3. **Prefix Sum**: Sum of all elements up to a certain index in the array.
    - Implementation involves iterating through the array and updating the prefix sum.

    - **Priority Queue**: A type of queue where each element has a priority, implemented often with a heap or sorted linked list.

### UNIT-IV
7. **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
    - Types: Full, Complete, Perfect, Balanced, etc.
    - **BST**: Binary tree where left child < parent < right child.

8. **Hashing**: Map keys to values using a hash function.
    - **Hash Table**: Array-based data structure to store key-value pairs.
    - **Search Techniques**: Sequential (linear), Binary, Interpolation Searches.
    - **Selection Sort**: Sorts by repeatedly finding the minimum element and putting it in the correct position.

### UNIT-V
9. **Graph**: Collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them.
    - Representations: Adjacency matrix, Adjacency list.
    - **Spanning Tree**: Subset of Graph covering all vertices with minimum edges.

10. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Finds shortest paths from the source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative weights.
